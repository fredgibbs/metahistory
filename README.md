# Metahistory
This repository hosts a website that provides an array of introductory essays for those interested in historiography---or the study of history. The website draws from several versions of a [historiography course](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/historiography) from the [History Department](http://history.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu). Enjoy!
